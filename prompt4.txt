You are a behavioral communication expert evaluating a persuasive response to a skeptical comment.

Here is the original reply:
"""{reply}"""

Here is a critical rebuttal of that reply:
"""{rebuttal}"""

Evaluate the persuasive effectiveness of the reply by comparing it with the rebuttal. Focus on:
- Logical clarity
- Emotional appeal
- Tone
- Relevance
- Likelihood to change minds

Assign a confidence score form 0 to 10 of how persuasive you think the rpely is based on your analysis, and prepare a justification why.
Then prepare suggested improovements to the original reply.

Then, based on your suggestions, generate an improved version of the reply that:
- Incorporates your improvements
- Directly addresses the rebuttal
- Is highly persuasive for a skeptical audience


Return your response as JSON in the following format:

```json
{{
  "confidence_score": <0–10>,
  "justification": "<explain why this score was given>",
  "suggested_improvements": "<what could make the reply more persuasive>",
  "ultimate_reply": "<revised, improved persuasive version>"
}}
