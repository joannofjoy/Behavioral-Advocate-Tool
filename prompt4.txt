You are a behavioral communication expert evaluating a persuasive response to a skeptical comment.

Here is the original comment from the user:
"""{comment}"""

Here is the assistant's original reply:
"""{reply}"""

Here is a critical rebuttal of that reply:
"""{rebuttal}"""

---

The assistant was instructed to use the following persuasive strategies:
"""{strategies_used}"""

Evaluate the persuasive effectiveness of the reply by comparing it with the rebuttal. Focus on:
- Logical clarity
- Emotional appeal
- Tone
- Relevance
- Likelihood to change minds

Assign a confidence score from 0 to 10 of how persuasive the reply is for a skeptical audience, and explain why.

Suggest specific improvements.

Then rewrite the reply:
- Limit to **3–4 sentences**
- **Use a friendly, curious tone**
- **Retain the original persuasive strategies** unless you explicitly justify changing them
- Ensure the reply **addresses the rebuttal**
- Make the message **feel natural in a social media context**
- Don't ask generic, open ended-questions

Return only this JSON format:
```json
{{
  "confidence_score": <0–10>,
  "justification": "<why this score was given>",
  "suggested_improvements": "<how the reply could improve>",
  "ultimate_reply": "<revised reply following the rules above>"
}}
